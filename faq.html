        Pet Waste Removal & Deodorizing FAQ – Da Boo Boos Queen
      </h2>
      <p style="max-width: 650px">
        Have questions about our Pet Waste Removal & Deodorizing in San Luis Obispo County? Here are
        the most common questions homeowners, renters, Airbnb hosts, and pet parents ask before
        scheduling pet waste removal.
      </p>

      <!-- Section: How it works -->
      <h2>How Our Pet Waste Removal Service Works</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>How does your pet waste removal service work?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          I come to your yard on a scheduled day, scoop all visible dog waste, secure it in bags,
          and place in your bin. For many clients in San Luis Obispo County, weekly service keeps
          the yard clean, sanitary, and guest-ready. One-time and first-time deep cleanups are also
          available.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Do I need to be home during service?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          No. You do not need to be home as long as I can safely access the yard. Most clients are
          at work or out running errands while I handle the cleanup.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>How do you handle locked gates?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          If you have a gate code, lockbox, or key, you can share that securely with me when you
          start service. I never climb fences or force gates. If access is blocked, I’ll contact you
          to reschedule.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>What do you do with the dog waste?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          By default,I double bag all pet waste then place it in your designated outdoor trash bin.
        </p>
      </details>

      <!-- Section: Pricing & scheduling -->
      <h2>Pricing, Scheduling, and Service Areas</h2>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>How much does pet waste removal cost?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Most recurring clients fall in the <strong>$24.99–$30 per visit</strong> range. Large
          yards will be quoted. One time cleanups start at $120 and will be quoted higher depending
          on the workload. You’ll always see your price up front before we begin.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Do you charge extra for large yards?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Yes, pricing can adjust for large yards because they simply require more time. I’ll factor
          this into your quote so there are no surprises.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Do you offer one-time or occasional cleanups?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Absolutely. One-time cleanups are great for move-ins, move-outs, Airbnb turnovers, or
          “it’s-been-a-while” yards. I also offer ongoing weekly pet waste removal for homeowners
          who want to keep things consistently clean.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>What areas do you serve?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Da Boo Boos Queen provides pet waste removal in <strong>San Luis Obispo County</strong>,
          including (but not limited to): Arroyo Grande, Grover Beach, Oceano Pismo Beach, San Luis
          Obispo, and surrounding Central Coast areas. If you’re nearby and not sure, just ask—I’ll
          let you know if you’re in the service area.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>
          <strong>Can you service Airbnb, rental, or commercial properties?</strong>
        </summary>
        <p>
          Yes. I work with homeowners, renters, Airbnb hosts, and small commercial properties such
          as shared yards or dog-friendly rentals. Regular pet waste removal keeps outdoor spaces
          clean and more pleasant for guests and tenants.
        </p>
      </details>

      <!-- Section: Sanitation & safety -->
      <h2>Sanitation, Safety, and Eco-Friendly Practices</h2>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Is your deodorizer safe for pets, kids, and plants?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Yes. I use a gentle, outdoor-friendly deodorizing treatment designed to help neutralize
          tough pet odors at their source rather than just masking them. It’s suitable for use
          around pets, kids, lawns, and gardens, and does not harm your plants or landscaping when
          applied as directed.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use a professional-grade deodorizing solution made from salt and water, activated to
          create hypochlorous acid (HOCl) — a naturally occurring compound that eliminates
          odor-causing bacteria and breaks down back into salt and water.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Do you sanitize your tools between yards?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Scoopers and tools are sanitized between properties to help minimize tracking
          bacteria or odors from one yard to another. Keeping equipment clean is part of keeping
          your yard clean.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>
          <strong>Will you deodorize patios, concrete, or high-traffic areas?</strong>
        </summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Upon request, I can apply an outdoor deodorizing treatment to patios, concrete, and
          common dog areas to help reduce lingering odors. This is especially helpful for
          high-traffic potty spots that tend to hold onto smells.
        </p>
      </details>

      <!-- Section: Trust & getting started -->
      <h2>Trust, Documentation, and Getting Started</h2>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Are you insured?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Da Boo Boos Queen operates as a professional pet waste removal service and maintains
          appropriate business coverage for the work performed in your yard.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Do you provide any proof of service?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Yes. I can provide outdoor-only photo or video confirmation of your completed service upon
          request. This gives you clear transparency about what was done while maintaining your
          privacy and peace of mind.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>How do I start or cancel service?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Getting started is simple—just call or text to share your address. I’ll confirm your quote
          and assign your service date. There are no long-term contracts, and you can pause or
          cancel service at any time with advance notice.
        </p>
